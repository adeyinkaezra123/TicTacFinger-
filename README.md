# Vanilla Javascript TicTacFinger🖕
###### Tictactoe Computer Simulation

Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a pencil, and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, then neither player will win.

** The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 💯**

## Why this Project ??🤔
> 1. To test My knowledge on Data Structures And Algorithims (_Trees to be precise_).
> 2. Building Games In Javascript is Fun 😁
> 3. To improve my knowledge on **ES6** and **OOP** (It was class-based, and I also leveraged the use of syntactic-sugary ES6 features.).
> 4. I felt intimidated when I saw Google's Version. (_Just search **" Tictactoe "**_)
> 5. Popular Phrase **_"Who knows, It might end up being the NEXT BIG THING🤣🤣🤣_**

## Up Next
> 1. Using Sockets to build one where people can Play from down the Hall or Thousands of Time Zones away.
